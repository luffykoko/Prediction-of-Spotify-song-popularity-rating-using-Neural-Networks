# Prediction-of-Spotify-song-popularity-rating-using-Neural-Networks
Predicting the song rating of Spotify songs based on the acoustic features of each song, taken from Spotify.
The dataset can be taken from my Kaggle using this link: https://www.kaggle.com/noelko/tracks


**Approaches**
The dataset contains acoustic features such as key, tempo, mood, daceability and more of a song on the Spotify library, and these will be the features used to predict the popularity rating, on a scale of 0 - 100. The _regression_ approach taken would out put the prediction as a numerical value, while the classification appraoch categorizes the ratings into 4 seperate classes of popularity.
